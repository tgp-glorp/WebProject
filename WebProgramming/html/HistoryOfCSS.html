  <h1>History of CSS:</h1>

  <h2>Origins of CSS:</h2>
  <p>
    CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) was first proposed by Norwegian technologist Hakon Wium Lee who was working with
    Tim-Burners Lee (creator of the world wide web and HTML) at CERN (Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire) in
    1994 due to the lack of styling using HTML, which he especially took note of due to working on personalized
    presentations in MIT Media Laboratory ,despite the presence of some style sheets at the time, those were more
    exclusive to certain browsers like Mosaic and were very limited in usage
    <a href="#ref1">[1]</a> .
    Moreover, the presence of CSS allowed for the separation of Styling from HTML which helps in separation of roles
    thus standardization and thus allows for better management of websites and interaction with said websites.
  </p>

  <p>
    "By separating the structure from the visual presentation of documents, we ensure the documents created today can
    also be displayed on the presentation devices of tomorrow," said Bert Bos, co-architect of CSS1. "HTML has become a
    universal storage format that will outlast current computers. CSS1, when used correctly, assures that documents can
    be preserved without sacrificing aesthetics on the Web."
    <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Bert Bos was working on his own new highly customizable browser with style sheets called Argo at the time that Hakon
    released his proposal, and due to the similarity of their philosophies he decided to join forces with Hakon,
    becoming the now known Co-Architect of CSS1, the first version of CSS to ever exist.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before CSS1 the inability to customize web pages was a major issue that a lot of authors new to the web were
    bothered by, unlike what is doable in Microsoft Word for example, at the time users of the web were unable to change
    fonts or colors of elements so documents looked bland and hard to read.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was to the point that Marc Andreesen, one of the creators of Mosaic and Co-Founders of Netscape says this on
    www-talk( an application on the web at the time):
  </p>
  <p class="Focus">
    In fact, it has been a constant source of delight for me over the past year to get to continually tell hordes
    (literally) of people who want to -- strap yourselves in, here it comes -- control what their documents look like in
    ways that would be trivial in TeX, Microsoft Word, and every other common text processing environment: "Sorry,
    you're screwed."
    <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>
  </p>
  <h2>The Elimination Process:</h2>
  <p class="bold">
    CSS was not the only suggested method of dealing with the lack of customizability of the web at the time, for
    example there was the Viola browser’s language made by Pei Wei;
  </p>

  <p>
    This language prioritized clear communication and context-based dialogue and thus was made to enhance teamwork
    between various researchers and developers, and it provided a versatile ability of customization.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the other hand, CSS prioritized effectiveness and separation of roles, by separating presentation from content,
    which are the cornerstones of modern-day software engineering and these were major reasons for its eventual success
    in this elimination battle.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, perhaps the greatest reason for CSS’s massive success was its flexibility and simplicity allowing for less
    tech literate users an easy way to customize their websites without compromising on effectiveness and this
    synergized perfectly with html’s goal being simplicity and ease of usage.
  </p>

  <h2>Popularization of CSS:</h2>
  <p>
    On December 17 1996, the W3C(World Wide Web Consortium) adopted the first standardized version of CSS called CSS1
    which was developed by Hakon Wium Lie and the Dutch programmer Bert Bos. The first browser to follow the
    recommendation of the W3C was Internet Explorer ,and this choice was one of the reasons IE was able to take over the
    browser scene despite Netscape’s massive dominance at the time (86% with IE being only 10%) to reach 99% by the year
    1999.
    <a href="#ref4">[4]</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    After the announcement by the W3C, CSS1 saw a massive boom across the world and an exclusive working group for CSS
    was created in the W3C in February 1997 aiming to further improve style sheets and add features not found in CSS1,
    and as of this date(9/24/2024) this group has reached 178 members from various international organizations working
    with the W3C including but not limited to Apple, Mozilla, Adobe Systems Inc., Google Inc. , Igalia and Microsoft
    according to the W3C.
